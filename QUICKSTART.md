1. **`01_data_preparation_and_feature_store.ipynb`** (~15 min)
   - Generates synthetic flight data
   - Creates Feature Store groups
   - Performs EDA

2. **`02_model_training_and_deployment.ipynb`** (~20 min)
   - Trains 3 models
   - Deploys best model to endpoint
   - Tests real-time predictions

3. **`03_model_monitoring.ipynb`** (~15 min)
   - Sets up monitoring schedule
   - Creates CloudWatch dashboards
   - Tests data drift detection

4. **`04_ci_cd_pipeline.ipynb`** (~30 min)
   - Builds SageMaker Pipeline
   - Tests quality gates
   - Registers models

5. **`05_batch_inference.ipynb`** (~15 min)
   - Runs batch predictions
   - Generates business insights

**Total Time:** ~90 minutes for complete MLOps system!

## ðŸŽ¬ Video Script Outline

### Introduction (1 min)
> "Hello, I'm [Your Name] from Team FlightGuard AI. Today I'll demonstrate our complete MLOps system for flight delay prediction built on AWS SageMaker."

### Business Context (1 min)
> "Flight delays cost airlines billions annually. Our system predicts delays before departure, enabling proactive operations and better passenger experience."

### Architecture Overview (1 min)
> "Our system includes data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, deployment, monitoring, and CI/CDâ€”all following MLOps best practices."

### Feature Store Demo (2 min)
> [Screen record Feature Store, show feature groups]
> "We've created two feature groups storing flight details and weather conditions. This enables consistent features across training and inference."

### Model Training & Deployment Demo (2 min)
> [Screen record endpoint and model registry]
> "We trained three models and deployed the best-performing XGBoost model to a real-time endpoint with 85% accuracy."

### Monitoring Demo (2 min)
> [Screen record CloudWatch]
> "Our monitoring system tracks data quality, model performance, and infrastructure health with automated alarms."

### CI/CD Pipeline Demo (3 min)
> [Screen record SageMaker Pipelines]
> "The CI/CD pipeline automates the entire workflow. Here's a successful execution... and here's a failed execution when quality thresholds weren't met."

### Batch Inference Demo (2 min)
> [Screen record batch results]
> "For operational planning, we process thousands of predictions in batch mode, identifying high-risk flights and problematic routes."

### Future Improvements (1 min)
> "Future enhancements include real-time weather integration, multi-model ensembles, and A/B testing capabilities."

### Conclusion (1 min)
> "Thank you for watching. Our complete codebase is available on GitHub, and we welcome questions."

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Tips

### Tip 1: Check Your Python Kernel
Make sure you're using `/opt/conda/bin/python` as specified.

### Tip 2: Watch for Costs
- Endpoint costs ~$150/month if left running
- Consider deleting endpoint after demo
- Keep monitoring schedule to capture results

### Tip 3: S3 Bucket
- All data automatically stored in default SageMaker bucket
- No manual bucket creation needed
- Easy to find: sagemaker-{region}-{account-id}

### Tip 4: Execution Time
- Pipelines take 20-30 minutes
- Start pipeline early
- Can continue with other notebooks while it runs

### Tip 5: Troubleshooting
If anything fails:
1. Check IAM role permissions
2. Verify S3 bucket access
3. Check CloudWatch logs
4. Ensure sufficient quota

## ðŸ†˜ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "ResourceLimitExceeded"
**Solution:** Request quota increase or use smaller instance type

### Issue: Pipeline stuck at "Starting"
**Solution:** Wait 2-3 minutes, pipelines take time to initialize

### Issue: Feature Group creation slow
**Solution:** Normal! Can take 3-5 minutes

### Issue: Endpoint deployment fails
**Solution:** Check role has `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess`

### Issue: Can't find CloudWatch dashboard
**Solution:** Ensure you created it in notebook 03, check region
